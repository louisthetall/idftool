"""Serial ports across a network (``rfc2217://``), tuned for its round trip.

esptool is written for a local port, where a round trip costs nothing. Across a network it
costs tens to hundreds of milliseconds, and two habits of esptool and pyserial turn that into
minutes:

- esptool waits 0.1 s for each sync reply and flushes its input before every retry, so a
  reply that takes longer than that is always thrown away and it never connects.
- esptool sets the port's read timeout around every command, and pyserial's RFC 2217 client
  renegotiates every port setting whenever any of them is set, the read timeout included
  (which is the client's alone), waiting for the server to confirm each. That is four
  round trips per command on top of the command's own.

:func:`prepare` fixes both for this process before a network port is opened.
